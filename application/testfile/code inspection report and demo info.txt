1. Significant component (Linnan, Jiabei)

There are some difficulties with connecting the database Mongo to Meteor. There is a lag resulting in displaying child orders on the front end not in the correct intervals. The child orders appear in a group of 3 instead of appearing one by one in the provided intervals. Unfortunately, this problem is difficult to overcome since the code is correct and the technology is lagging. A potential solution to lower these inconsistencies would be to send an http request to Mongo which would likely speed everything up.

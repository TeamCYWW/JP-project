In addition to Sys test, here are reson for not being 100% in unit test:   
In main.py, these lines are unavailable:  
except Exception as info: 
        print info 
        return "database not available2"  
        
except Exception as info: 
        print "can not read record from database" 
        return str(info)

The reason we cannot reach them is that the database exception are tested before that. So if the database has connection probelm, these two exceptino will not be occured.  



This is log for system test:
